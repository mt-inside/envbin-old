external IP (via a service) and DNS name of that IP
this is envbin - throw it somewhere and have it tell you where it is. It should show:
- docker stats
- azure, GCE, etc
- env vars
- filesystems, df, etc
- cpu, ram, etc
- all interfaces
- traceroute to 8.8.8.8 (seoarate endpoint)
- virtwhat
Smallest image that will do (that will run infrabin, even if it needs copying in manually)
