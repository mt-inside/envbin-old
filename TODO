Readme - this is about the containerâ€™s hosting. If you want to know about its external connectivity, use infra bin, if you want to know about your *client*, use httpbin
Background the slow tasks (use pusher to update the page) async - or in response to ajax calls to endpoints - does go http run your handler on a grouting or do you need to spawn one?)
use telepresence to debug on k8s
external IP (via a service) and DNS name of that IP
this is envbin - throw it somewhere and have it tell you where it is. It should show:
- docker stats
- azure, GCE, etc
- env vars
- filesystems, df, etc
- cpu, ram, etc
- all interfaces
- traceroute to 8.8.8.8 (seoarate endpoint)
- client ip & name
- external IP & name
- virt-what
docker auto build.
